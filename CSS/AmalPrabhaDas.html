		<p>In 1934, Amal Prabha had the chance to interact with Mahatma Gandhi, who stayed at her house during his visit to Guwahati. The meeting influenced her greatly and motivated her to work for the welfare of the society.Amal Prabha along with her mother visited the Maganbari Centre of Self Development at Wardha in 1939 to learn about the village reform activities. The family soon set up indigenous industries on their land in the Sarania Hills and began training the local people in small-scale industries and handicraft work.When Kasturba Gandhi died in 1944, Mahatma Gandhi set up the Kasturba Gandhi Memorial Trust. He appointed Amal Prabha to supervise its work in the Northeast. The Sarania Hills ashram was renamed as the Kasturba Ashram. “Yeh ladki chatur hain, kam kar sakti hain,” Gandhiji said about Amal Prabha when he visited the ashram in 1946. Later, the Kasturba Ashram helped establish 21 Gram Sevika Kendras in Arunachal Pradesh.In 1950 when a devastating earthquake hit Assam, members of Kasturba Ashram and the Gram Seva Kendras helped in the relief work. Under the aegis of the Kasturba Ashram, Kasturba Kalyan Kendra was established at Lakhimpur to help those who were rendered homeless by the earthquake. She also set up Guwahati Yubak Sevadal to fight untouchability and worked closely with Vinoba Bhave’s Bhoodan Movement.</p>
